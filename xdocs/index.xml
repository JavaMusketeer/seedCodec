    <section name="Compression and Decompression">
      <p>This is a collection of compression and decompression routines
for standard seismic data formats in Java. The goal is to support all
the formats available within seed, but submissions from the broader
community are needed to accomplish this.
         </p>
      <p>The current supported formats are Steim1 (compression and decompression), steim2 (decompression only) and the simple float, int, double and short
types. </p>
       <p>A jar can be downloaded
         <a href="/software/mavenRepository/SeedCodec/jars">here</a>. The
         source code can be 
<a href="/fisheye/browse/seis/trunk/SeedCodec">browsed here</a> and 
<a href="/software/mavenRepository/SeedCodec/distributions/">downloaded here</a>.
